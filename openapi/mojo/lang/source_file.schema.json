{"title":"mojo.lang.SourceFile","description":"A File node represents a Mojo source file.\n\nThe Comments list contains all comments in the source file in order of\nappearance, including the comments that are pointed to from other nodes\nvia Doc and Comment fields.\n\nFor correct printing of source code containing comments (using packages\ngo/format and go/printer), special care must be taken to update comments\nwhen a File's syntax tree is modified: For printing, comments are interspersed\nbetween tokens based on their position. If syntax tree nodes are\nremoved or moved, relevant comments in their vicinity must also be removed\n(from the File.Comments list) or moved accordingly (by updating their\npositions). A CommentMap may be used to facilitate some of these operations.\n\nWhether and how a comment is associated with a node depends on the\ninterpretation of the syntax tree by the manipulating program: Except for Doc\nand Comment comments directly associated with nodes, the remaining comments\nare \"free-floating\" (see also issues #18593, #20744).\n","type":"object","properties":{"attributes":{"description":"循环依赖文件名称 'circle_dependency'","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Attribute"}},"dependencies":{"description":"","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.SourceFile"}},"fullName":{"type":"string"},"imports":{"description":"imports decl index for this file, will still exist in the statements","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.ImportDecl"}},"name":{"type":"string"},"packageName":{"type":"string"},"resolvedIdentifiers":{"description":"resolved identifiers not in this source file","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Identifier"}},"scope":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Scope"},"statements":{"description":"statements in this file","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Statement"}},"tailingComments":{"description":"comments after all statements but before the end of the source file","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Comment"}},"unresolvedIdentifiers":{"description":"unresolved identifiers in this file","type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/mojo.lang.Identifier"}},"url":{"type":"string","format":"url"}}}
